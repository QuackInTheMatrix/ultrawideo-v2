## More information

This extension resolves aspect ratio incompatibility with Ultra Wide screens.
You may play 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio videos and they will be properly shown on 21:9 aspect ratio screens, without black side edges.

You may want to choose "Stretch mode" when you are watching some videos where a person is present in front of you as otherwise the person's forehead may be cropped...

The extension have three simple options. There's no need for complexity that some other extensions provide, it's confusing.

1. pause the extension
2. use "upscale" mode
3. use "stretch" mode

With these two modes, you'll be able to control any video on the web as you desire.
